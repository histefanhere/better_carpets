A new and improved carpet teleportation system for Geek NZ

Geek NZ is a New Zealand-based Minecraft SMP server. From the [minecraft-mp page](https://minecraft-mp.com/server-s13774):

> Our small New Zealand based server has always been popular with friends and family. We run a vanilla server on PaperMC with a few small additions to make life a little easier. If you are a nice person you are welcome to join us.

## "a few small additions"?

To try and keep the server as vanilla as possible, we have a unique carpet teleportation system that aims to replace the `/home`, `/tpa`, `/warp` and other commands from non-vanilla servers; not only does this keep the experience on Geek NZ purer, but it's much funner :). This repository is a datapack for an improved version of this tp system

## Advantages

### _Safe_
- The countdown means _no more accidental teleports!_
- When you tp from red -> green there is a cooldown that prevents you from stepping on any other carpet
- Don't want to get teleported when stepping on a carpet? Just shift sneak onto it, and it will act just like any other boring mesh of wool
### _Stable_ 
- The carpets have been extensively tested and built for maximum stability
- In theory there should be _less_ lag (on average) than the original carpet system
### _Secure_
- When on a red carpet you are told exactly who you're teleporting to
- When on a orange carpet you are told exactly who you're sending items to
- The commands prevent someone from stepping on lime when someone's already on it, meaning no one can intercept the items
### _Visual_
- For both new players and experienced, being shown live where the carpets lead and what they do is priceless
- And I mean, come on, who doesn't like a nice visual progress bar animation?

## Disadvantages
