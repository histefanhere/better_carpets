TODO:

IDEAS/IMPROVEMENTS:
- instead of saying "Teleporting to: *spawn*" maybe just say "*spawn*"?


COMPLETED:
- readme
- instructions
    - write down all in game commands
    - SETUP.md
- comment code files
- lime/orange carpets should block a 3rd participant from joining in on the trade of items
- 2 on orange -> 1 on lime
    - might need to split up the one line command in `main`
orange doesn't show title when there's an active trade happening
- BORDERLANDS PLAYERS SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET TO wilderness
- + what else does the `admin` tag override?
- purple carpets
- different tp points for different dimensions OR NOT AT ALL
- integrate with existing team system
- maybe totally different entries in `generate_carpets.py` for different carpet's destinations?
    - (this would let us make each carpet's destination dimenion also show a different title)
    - E.G. in overworld, white carpet would show "Teleporting to: *spawn*" but in end "Teleporting to: *end portal*"
    - SUPER simple to do, just add more entries to python script.
    - disadvantage is it wouldn't be configurable from within the mc world
- if `pvp` team is implemented then red/action needs to be updated
- fix 2 not being able to be on a carpet at the same time
- red/green should say "waiting for player ON RED" and "waiting for player ON GREEN"
- header comments in EVERY file CODE TOO
- generate_carpets.py should delete folders first then generate them
- fix template files coming up in the server log
- red/action needs all team colours
- should be able to continue recieving players even after one has already been recieved
- test leaving red/green carpets early
- if someone is already on a red carpet prevent anyone else from entering one
- put countdown stuff into its own folder
- tags for colour/subtitle, colour/entering, colour/leaving
- red/green carpets should have a cooldowns
- opted for `registriies` instead of tags so we have less conditions and fuctions overall
    - no need for each carpet's 'entry' function
- script for generating home AND white, yellow and blue mcfunctions
    - template needs comments and header
